The chief project of CS 250: Object Oriented Programming.

== Prerequisites

You have to download link:https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/[JavaFX],
then extract the files to the appropriate directory.

You also need link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/junit/junit/4.13.2/[JUnit 4.13.2]
in your `+lib+` directory.
and link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/junit/platform/junit-platform-console-standalone/1.9.2/[the JUnit console jar v1.9.3]
in your `+bin+` directory
if you don't want the tests to autofail.

NOTE: JavaFX versions other than 17 tend to not work very well. you should download JavaFX 17, even if your Java version
_technically_ qualifies you for another JavaFX version.
